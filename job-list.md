I guess if you want to read the list of experiences that I have done, you don't just want to see the dates and the places, but you want to actually feel what I have experienced and learnt. That's a short story behind the few steps that I did in my previous career.
There is a big chapter of my life that widely opened my mind. After the highschool I've attempted Uni, but I found it very disappointing. Especially in Italy, where you can not expect to actually learn something from public Universities. 
So while I was waiting to understand what to do in life, I though that learning new languages would have been fun, and also making some experiences would have helped me to grow.
I took a decision then! Investing a few years traveling, in order to see what the world is out of my hometown. What a journey..

Here is the list of places that I've visited and worked in, from the beginning, to the most recent one.

###ECV Park Albatros Camping Village
#####[01/03/2010 – 30/09/2010] Livorno - Italy
Yes, as you might wonder, I am still in Italy. I needed a few skills and a bit of experience to find a job abroad..
I like chemistry and I like experimenting mixing things. Bartending maybe..? Bartending!
As soon as I finished a bartending course, the company who taught me how to mix drinks and do fancy tricks wth bottles, asked me to join their team on the seaside of Tuscany for a seasonal project in a camping village, with a bar and a disco.
After two months I was getting good with cocktails and, after seeing me putting a lot of effort to learn new things and work hard, they asked me to take care of a part of the team, the disco staff.
As I was very surprised about the offer, I was extremely ready and excited about the result that I had achieved, and even more when the season ended and we got a very good feedback from the camping.

###Restaurant “Assaggi”
#####[15/01/2011 – 18/07/2011] Melbourne - Australia
A little bit of rest after the season, keep meditating, looking for the perfect place to start and suddenly realising that it doesn't matter where to start, the only thing that matters is TO START!
Ticket bought, luggage ready, passport updated.. And I am flying to Australia!
Melbourne is awesome, big skyscrapers, everyone is super busy, everyone is running but also finding the time to stop for a second and star at the street artists..
I was working in an Italian restaurant/coffee bar, and I was behind the coffee machine. i found all the customer very picky about their coffees, and it sounded strange at the beginning.
Working in there I've increased my multitasking skill and I've learnt how to think quick. I was always under pressure for the huge amount of coffees to make and the high standards, and I started to learn how to manage the stress and break big things into smaller and fix them individually.
Australia was great, but I was eager to learn more about bartending and customer experience in different environments.

###Relais & Chateaux - Lime Wood Hotel
#####[06/08/2011 – 06/04/2012] Lyndhurst - England
The job that I wanted was in a five star hotel, so I started to find ways trhough my network in order to get an interview in a high-level hotel, and I made it!
The hiring process was short but intense, one phone interview, one Skype interview and a technical chat with the bar manager, but after a few day I was in.
The thing that made me very excited as soon as I started to be a part of the team, it wasn't just interacting with VIPs like, football players or singers or even actors, but the massive amount of choices that a customer had. From top-shelf spirits to very rare cigars, even fancy combinations between food and spa treatments. Everything was so expensive and it was very hard to find the perfect match between the customer's needs and the hotel's profit. I really enjoyed 'stealing' dealing skills from my colleagues and then put those skills in my set of tools.
