#Job List
I guess if you want to read the list of experiences that I have done, you don't just want to see the dates and the places where I've woked, but you want to actually feel what I have experienced and learnt. There is a big chapter of my life that widely opened my mind. 
While I was waiting to understand what to do in life, I thought that learning new languages could be fun, and also I could find some experiences that would help me to grow.
I took a decision then! To invest a few years in travelling, in order to see what the world is like out of my hometown.

Here are the step that have contributed to my growth, from the beginning, to the most recent one.

###ECV Park Albatros Camping Village
#####[01/03/2010 – 30/09/2010] Livorno - Italy
I needed a few skills and a bit of experience to find a job abroad..
I like chemistry and I like experimenting mixing things. Bartending was the job for me.
As soon as I finished a bartending course, the company who taught me how to mix drinks and do fancy tricks wth bottles, asked me to join their team on the seaside of Tuscany for a seasonal project in a camping village, with a bar and a disco.
After two months I was getting good with cocktails, and after seeing me put a lot of effort into learning new things and working hard, they asked me to take care of the disco staff. I was extremely ready for and excited about the position I'd earned, and even more when the season ended and we got very good feedback from the campsite owners.

###Restaurant “Assaggi”
#####[15/01/2011 – 18/07/2011] Melbourne - Australia
After a little bit of rest following the season, I kept meditating, looking for the perfect place to start and suddenly realised that it doesn't matter where to start, the only thing that matters is TO START!
Ticket bought, luggage ready, passport updated.. And I am flying to Australia!
Melbourne is awesome, big skyscrapers, everyone is super busy, everyone is running but also finding the time to stop for a second and stare at the street artists..
While I was working in an Italian restaurant/coffee bar, taking complex orders from customers helped me rapidly improve my English. I also increased my multitasking skill and learnt how to think quickly. I was always under pressure for the huge amount of coffees to make and the high standards, and I started to learn how to manage the stress and break big things into smaller pieces and fix them individually.
Australia was great, but I was eager to learn more about bartending and customer experience in different environments.

###Relais & Chateaux - Lime Wood Hotel
#####[06/08/2011 – 06/04/2012] Lyndhurst - England
The job that I wanted was in a five star hotel, so I started to search through my network in order to get an interview in a high-level hotel, and I made it!
The thing that made me very excited as soon as I started to be a part of the team, it wasn't just interacting with VIPs like  football players, singers, or even actors, but the massive amount of choice that a customer had. From top-shelf spirits to very rare cigars, even fancy combinations between food and spa treatments. I was responsible for reaching the perfect balance between the customers needs and the hotels profit. I really enjoyed acquiring dealing skills from my colleagues and putting those skills in my set of tools. Working at such a high standard required me to improve my English as well.

###Belmond - La Residencia
#####[01/05/2012 – 30/09/2012] Deia` - Spain
Mallorca is one of the best islands of Europe, the weather and the people are special.
I was very lucky to live the sensation of spending a season in a very good resort situated north of the island.
As I had experience in mixing techniques and supervising a team, as well as extensive customer experience skills, I was asked to be in charge of a lounge bar situated in a garden underneath the main bar.
Every day, at the main briefing, I was choosing the team of 6 people plus me, to work on that bar.
As we always had different type of customers, setting the daily goals was crucial and challenging.
I was working with a team of 80% Spanish people, so I took another challenge and learnt that new language.

###Hard Rock Cafe`
#####[22/04/2013 – 20/10/2013] Florence - Italy
After Mallorca and a bit of rest, I went to Berlin. I was very curious of how long it would take to learn German. I spent two months studying with a private teacher and I was able to make an order to a restaurant, which it seems easy but it's not, believe me. Before looking for a job I decided to spend some time with my family as I actually never stopped, so I went back to Italy. I then went to work at Hard Rock Cafe` in Florence.
Working there was fun, with lots of colleagues and customers from all around the world, and lots of team challenges set by the team managers. It was great because we had to respect the deadlines and not always we had achieved what was required us to achieve, so it was very interesting to see how we could decide, during the scrums, what decisions to take.

###Agua Kitchen & Showroom
##### [05-01-2014 - 01-09-2014] Bologna - Italy
Here is where I ended the cycle; to complete the hospitality chapter of my life I wanted to work in a kitchen, and this happened in Bologna, a beautiful city, famous for its food tradition, and good restaurants.
I worked with the best team ever, 80% of it not even professionals, but with a great attitude and passion for what they were doing. I was personally in charge of the kitchen staff, and coordinating menu styling and hosting private events and shows together with the owner.
