A pro-active Web Developer who loves to tinker with new technologies in order to build [random] stuff.  Now learning AngularJS and C#.
Robotics enthusiast, my final project at high school was about home automation. When I am not too busy trying to build video games I also type random words on my [blog](http://matteomanzo.github.io/). Check it out!

##Skills

###Teamwork

Either working or playing sports, I much prefer working in teams.

- Pair programming and scrums at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) (co-op projects and final project);
- I led a team of 6 people at [La Residencia](http://www.belmond.com/la-residencia-mallorca/) (daily briefings and setting goals);
- Bar/kitchen/floor teamwork at [Lime Wood](http://www.limewoodhotel.co.uk/) and [Hard Rock Cafe'](http://www.hardrock.com/cafes/florence/) (event handling and brainstorming);
- I played Basketball and I've been involved in a Flag-Throwers folkloristic group. Ok, it's easier to show you an example! I am one of the blues, at the very right in [Segovia - Spain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-7yq0_5GkA); and same colour, front row, the second starting from the right in [Marostica - Italy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8_ShYrwOrY)

###Customer service

As I have been always working with customers in hotels, I have learnt how to handle customer's needs.

- Customise the user experience such as for the client to be the best option and for the hotel to get the best value. 
- Find valuable alternatives in case we couldn't provide the customer's original request.

###Polyglot

- I was born in Italy, so my first language is Italian,
- I have learnt English while I was living in Melbourne, Southampton and London,
- I have learnt Spanish when I lived in Mallorca,
- I have attended a German basic course in Berlin for two months.

##Other skills

###Entrepreneurship

I see opportunities everywhere, and I do everything to bring them to life. In my hometown, which is full of leather artisans, I am creating a [network](http://www.muntuch.com/) to connect the local artisans to the customers who want to buy handmade shoes, thus keeping the craftmanship tradition alive.
I also have a shop on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Rogante).

###Do it Yourself!
I love to create things by myself.. In my arsenal you might find:

- A bamboo fly fishing rod;
- A Cinema cart;
- A Cinema shoulder pad;

I just go crazy when I find any device that I could disassemble, have a look inside, break it, fix it and reassemble it.
