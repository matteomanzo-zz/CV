#Matteo Manzo
A pro-active Web Developer who loves to tinker with new technologies in order to build [random] stuff. Robotics enthusiast, my final project at high school was about home automation. I've completed a 12-weeks, very intensive bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) and I am now ready to join a team of great developers to work with, and conquer the world!
When I am not too busy trying to build video games I also type random words on my [blog](http://matteomanzo.github.io/). Check it out!

##Skills

###Teamwork

Either working or playing sports, I much prefer working in teams.

- Pair programming and scrums at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) (co-op projects and final project)
- 6 weeks mentoring the junior students at Makers
- I led a team of 6 people at [La Residencia](http://www.belmond.com/la-residencia-mallorca/) (daily briefings and setting goals)
- Bar/kitchen/floor teamwork at [Lime Wood](http://www.limewoodhotel.co.uk/) and [Hard Rock Cafe'](http://www.hardrock.com/cafes/florence/) (event handling and brainstorming)
- I played Basketball and I've been involved in a Flag-Throwers folkloristic group. Ok, it's easier to show you an example! I am one of the blues, at the very right in [Segovia - Spain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-7yq0_5GkA); and same colour, front row, the second starting from the right in [Marostica - Italy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8_ShYrwOrY)

###Code good practices

I became a Web Developer at Makers, coding from day 1 to the last. Although I was new to code, it has been natural for me to pick up how to code following good practices such as writing user stories, spend a lot of time thinking about the design of the application before I type a line of code, follow the SOLID principles and, last but not least, test drive!

###Customer service

As I have been always working with customers in hotels, I have learnt how to handle customer's needs.

- I strived to create the best user experience for every client, whilst delivering value and meeting sales targets for the hotel.
- Find valuable alternatives in case we couldn't provide the customer's original request

###Entrepreneurship

I see opportunities everywhere, and I do everything to bring them to life. In my hometown, which is full of leather artisans, I am creating a [network](http://www.muntuch.com/) to connect the local artisans to the customers who want to buy handmade shoes, thus keeping the craftmanship tradition alive.
I also have a shop on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Rogante).
- Managing the supply chain: Identifying and building relationships with artisan suppliers that match our quality requirements
- Online marketing: A/B testing, multiple sale channels to identify the most reliable source of customers for our business

###Polyglot

- I was born in Italy, so my first language is Italian
- I speak fluent English. I learnt it while I was living in Melbourne, Southampton and London
- I have a professional working proficiency in Spanish. I learnt it when I lived in Mallorca
- I have attended a German basic course in Berlin for two months

###Do it Yourself!

I love to create things by myself, and I just go crazy when I find any device that I could disassemble, have a look inside, break it, fix it and reassemble it.
In my arsenal you might find:

- A bamboo fly fishing rod;
- A Cinema cart;
- A Cinema shoulder pad;
