#Matteo Manzo
A pro-active Web Developer who loves to tinker with new technologies in order to build [random] stuff. Robotics enthusiast, my final project at high school was about home automation. I've completed a 12-weeks, very intensive bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) and I am now working at [comparethemarket.com](http://www.comparethemarket.com/)!
When I am not too busy trying to build video games I vent banging my head on the keyboard while I'm writing on my [blog](http://matteomanzo.github.io/). Check it out!

##My Skills Set

###Teamwork

Working alone may be more productive for some people, but I much prefer working in teams.

- Daily pair rotations in my current team at [comparethemarket.com](http://www.comparethemarket.com/)
- Pair programming and scrums at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) (co-op projects and final project)
- 6+ weeks mentoring the junior students at Makers (and more mentoring after)
- I led a team of 6 people at [La Residencia](http://www.belmond.com/la-residencia-mallorca/) (daily briefings and goals setting)

###Adaptability

I love change, so I am able to switch tasks and environments very rapidly.
Working on different products allows me to invest a lot of time learning new technologies, therefore being able to choose the right tool to solve the problem.

- Load tested a website using both Locust.io (Python based) and Visual Studio Enterprise 2015 (C#)
- Converted apps from C# to AngularJS
- Changed team and product every week during my experience at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/)

###Code best practices

I became a Web Developer at Makers, coding from day 1. Although I was new to programming, it has been natural for me to pick up how to code following good practices such as writing user stories, agile working, follow the SOLID principles and, last but not least, test drive!

###Entrepreneurship

I see opportunities everywhere, and I do everything to bring them to life. In my hometown, which is full of leather artisans, I am creating a [network](http://www.muntuch.com/) to connect the local artisans to the customers who want to buy handmade shoes, thus keeping the craftmanship tradition alive.
I also have a shop on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Rogante).
- Managing the supply chain: Identifying and building relationships with artisan suppliers that match our quality requirements
- Online marketing: A/B testing, multiple sale channels to identify the most reliable source of customers for our business

###Customer service

A customer is a person who pays for a service, which is good. Most of the times though, this person misunderstand the difference between giving an order to a servant and actually knowing what to ask, which is bad.
Helping the customer to understand what is effectively the product that he's looking for, made my life (and my job) much easier.
As I have been always working with customers in hotels, I have learnt how to handle these customer's needs.

- I strived to create the best user experience for every client, from the beginning to the end, whilst delivering value and meeting sales targets for the business
- Find valuable alternatives in case we couldn't provide the customer's original request and let the customer understand the reason

###Polyglot

- I was born in Italy, so my first language is Italian
- I speak fluent English. I learnt it while I was living in Melbourne, Southampton and London
- I have a professional working proficiency in Spanish. I learnt it when I lived in Mallorca
- I have attended a German basic course in Berlin for two months

###Do it Yourself!

I love to create things by myself, and I just go crazy when I find any device that I could disassemble, have a look inside, break it, fix it and reassemble it.
In my arsenal you might find:

- A bamboo fly fishing rod;
- A Cinema cart;
- A Cinema shoulder pad;
