#Matteo Manzo
A pro-active Web Developer who loves to tinker with new technologies in order to build [useless] stuff.
Robotics enthusiast, my final project at high school was about home automation. When I am not too busy trying to build video games I also type random words on my [blog](http://matteomanzo.github.io/). Check it out!

##Skills

###Teamwork

Either working or playing sports, I much prefer working in team.

- Pair programming at Makers Academy (co-op projects and final project);
- Bar/kitchen/floor teamwork at Lime Wood, La Residencia and Hard Rock Cafe' (event handling and brainstorming).

###Customer service

As I have been working in five star hotel in England and Spain, I have learnt how to interact and deal with very demanding customers.
In order to satisfy the client needing I was required to:

- Customise the user experience such as for the client to be the best option and for the hotel to get the best value. 
- Find valuable alternatives in case we couldn't provide the customer's original request.

###Polyglot

- My native language is Italian
- I have learnt English while I was living in Melbourne, Southampton and London,
- I have learnt Spanish when I lived in Mallorca,
- I have attended a German basic course in Berlin for two months.

##Other skills

###Entrepreneurship

I see opportunities everywhere, and I do everything to bring them to life. In my hometown, which is full of leather artisans, I created a network to connect the local artisans to the customers who want to buy handmade shoes, thus keeping the craftmanship tradition alive.
I also have a shop on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Rogante).

###Do it Yourself!
I love to create things by myself.. In my arsenal you might find:

- A bamboo fly fishing rod;
- A Cinema cart;
- A Cinema shoulder pad;

I just go crazy when I find any device that I could disassemble, have a look inside and reassemble it.
